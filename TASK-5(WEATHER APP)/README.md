# 🌦️ Weather App

## 📚 Project 5 out of 5

Welcome to the Weather App! This is an advanced weather application developed as part of my internship at ProdigyInfotech. The app provides real-time weather information for any location you enter. It showcases various features and styling to enhance user experience.

## 📋 Features

- **Dynamic Weather Information**: Fetches and displays current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Stylish Design**: Features a sleek, modern interface with a blurred background and smooth animations.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes to ensure a great experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Error Handling**: Provides user feedback if the location is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating visually appealing effects.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions and fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Boxicons**: For icons used in the application.

## 🛠️ How It Works
